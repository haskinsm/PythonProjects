"""
You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n,
representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1.
To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should
be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.
"""

# Remember dealing with two sorted arrays 
# len(num1) == n + m
# So swap the biggest element at each stage to the highest index that hasnt already has an element sent to it.
# Dont need these numbers are the higher index, they are being overwritten 

def merge(nums1, m, nums2, n):
        while m > 0 and n > 0:
